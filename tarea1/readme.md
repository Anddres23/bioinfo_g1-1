# EJERCICIO 1.10.3 REDES DE POLINIZADORES DE PLANTAS 
Saavedra and Stouffer (2013) studied several plant polllinator networks. These can be represented as rectangular matrices
where the rows are pollinators, the columns plants, a 0 indicates the absence and 1 the presence of an interaction between the
plant and the pollinator. The data of Saavedra and Stouffer (2013) can be found in the directory CSB/unix/data/Saavedra2013.

# EJERCICIO PARTE 1 
1. Write a script that takes one of these files and determines the number of rows (pollinators) and columns (plants). Note that
columns are separated by spaces and that there is a space at
the end of each line. Your script should return.
